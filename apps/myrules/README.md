# My Rules Applet for Tidbyt

Displays rules to live by, that you can set yourself.

As a prerequisite, you need to be able to host a simple text file somewhere,
where Tidbyt can get to it. Use [GitHub](https://github.com), for example.

In the text file, you may list each of your rules separated by newlines.
See the [default rules file](https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/myrules/rules.csv)
as an example.
